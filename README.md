# Image-Classification-ANN-vs-CNN-
This project implements **image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset** using both an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.   The goal is to compare performance of fully-connected vs convolutional approaches on small image datasets.
